  <h1 class="title">Mechanical Systems Strategist</h1>
  <p class="lede">
    I design, test, and refine immersive mechanical experiences that blend tactile engineering with
    digital storytelling. The portfolio cube is my navigation playground, and every panel hides a
    narrative worth exploring.

    <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      I believe in modular systems that can be pulled apart, studied, and reassembled into something
      stronger. Each interaction is prototyped physically before it becomes a digital animation, ensuring
      that motion feels purposeful and precise.

    <h2>Current Focus</h2>
    <p>
      Crafting portfolio experiences that feel engineered rather than templated. Recent experiments
      include kinetic layouts, physics-driven navigation, and collaborative documentation pipelines that
      keep teams aligned.
