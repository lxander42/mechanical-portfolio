# Mechanical Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio project built with the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js) to showcase my work as a Mechanical Engineer. The design is inspired by an **ASME standard mechanical drawing**, aiming to replicate its style, with clean lines, monochromatic colors, and a grid-like layout. It contains four main sections: About, Resume, Portfolio, and Wiki.
